1. **Vulnerable Code Example**:
   ```javascript
   await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}' LIMIT 1`);
   ```

2. **Demonstration of SQL Injection**:
   - **Scenario**: Imagine a user inputs the following for `username` and `password`:
     - `username`: `admin`
     - `password`: `' OR '1'='1`
   - **Injected SQL Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '' OR '1'='1' LIMIT 1
     ```
   - **Explanation**: This query will always return true due to the `OR '1'='1'` condition, potentially granting unauthorized access to the first user in the database, often an admin account.

3. **Teaching the Consequences**:
   - Explain how this vulnerability can allow an attacker to bypass authentication.
   - Highlight the potential risks, such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and system compromise.

4. **Solution - Using Prepared Statements**:
   - Modify the query to use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
   - Example with Prepared Statement:
     ```javascript
     await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ? LIMIT 1`, [username, password]);
     ```
   - This method ensures that user input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL command, effectively mitigating the risk of SQL injection.


5. **Vulnerable Code Example**:
   ```javascript
   await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}' LIMIT 1`);
   ```

6. **Demonstration of SQL Injection for Specific User**:
   - **Scenario**: An attacker wants to sign in as the "admin" user without knowing the actual password.
   - **Injected Input**:
     - `username`: `admin' --`
     - `password`: (Can be anything, it will be ignored)
   - **Injected SQL Query**:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'any_password' LIMIT 1
     ```
   - **Explanation**: Here, the `--` (double dash) is a SQL comment. Everything after `--` is ignored by the SQL server. This effectively turns the query into a check if there is a user with the username 'admin', without checking the password.

7. **Consequences and Risks**:
   - Explain that this type of injection can lead to unauthorized access to specific user accounts, especially accounts with higher privileges like admin accounts.
   - Discuss potential risks such as data theft, privilege escalation, and unauthorized actions performed under the compromised account.

8. **Secure Solution - Prepared Statements**:
   - Revise the query to use prepared statements.
   - Example with Prepared Statement:
     ```javascript
     await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ? LIMIT 1`, [username, password]);
     ```
   - Prepared statements ensure that the input for the `username` and `password` is not treated as part of the SQL command.


Absolutely, I can provide a few more SQL injection examples for educational purposes. These examples will help demonstrate different ways SQL injection can be exploited and why it's crucial to write secure code.

### Bypassing Authentication (Different Method)

**Vulnerable Code Example**:
```javascript
await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${username}' AND password = '${password}' LIMIT 1`);
```

**Injected Input**:
- `username`: `' OR 1=1 --`
- `password`: (Can be anything, it will be ignored)

**Injected SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = 'any_password' LIMIT 1
```

**Explanation**:
- The `1=1` condition is always true, leading to the selection of all users. The comment `--` negates the password check, potentially logging in the attacker as the first user in the database.
